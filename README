Qt 5 QPA hwcomposer plugin
==========================

This QPA plugin allows rendering on top of libhybris-based hwcomposer EGL
platforms. The hwcomposer API is specific to a given Droid release, and
sometimes also SoC type (generic, qcom, exynos4, ...).

This plugin is derived from the "eglfs" plugin, but removes some parts of
it that would make it harder to integrate hwcomposer features into the QPA.


Build requirements
------------------

  - Qt 5 devel packages
  - libhybris devel packages
  - Droid headers
